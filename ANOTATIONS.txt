ADD A NEW COLUMN NAME "CLTSTATUS", THE ZERO "0" MEANS ISN'T LOGGED, THE ONE "1" MEANS IS LOGGED.
I NEED THIS TO VALIDATE IF CLIENT CAN CREATE A NEW CREDIT CARD.
CLIENT ONLY CAN CREATE A NEW CARD IF HE IS LOGGED.

ADD A NEW COLUMN NAME "CLTEMAILVALIDATED", ZERO "0" IF HE DID NOT VALIDATE THE EMAIL AND ONE "1" 
IF HE VALIDATED THE EMAIL.

I WLL DO THE SAME THING TO PROVIDERS TABLE.
